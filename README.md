Howdy! I'm ansthomp, but most people tend to call me Ansley. But whatever floats your boat.

Big fan of climbing rocks, cooking food and eating it with people who make me happy, and being outside.

Sometimes I code, here are the passion projects from those moments.

If you need to contact me, we'll run into each other, I'm sure of it (or just send a smoke signal or carrier pigeon)
